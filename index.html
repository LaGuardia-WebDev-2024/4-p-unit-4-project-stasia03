    <h2>Here is how I prep them for the show!</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Groom the cats. Grooming a cat will give your cats fur coat a nice shine
        to it and make their fur really soft and presentable for the show. It
        isnt out of order to spend hours grooming your cat to amke sure their
        fur looks and feels perfect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trim the nails. Keeping up with the maintenance of cutting your cats
        nails is very important. It allows their nails to stay healthy.
        Neglecting your cats nails can cause them to overgrow and can grow into
        their paw pads, causing severe pain and infections for your cat. Though,
        only cut off the tips of the cats nails, trimming too far down can cause
        damage to the cats skin and could bleed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get your cat checked out by the Vet. Making sure your cat is in top
        condition is key to their performance during the contest. Get your cat
        all the neccessary vaccinations so they wont catch any infectious
        diseases at the show.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare for travel. Obviously youre going to need to bring your cat to
        the Cat Show, so make sure they have nice presentable show cage, with
        food, water, a blanket that the cat can lay on comfortably. Making sure
        your cats have the supplies they need to remain calm and not feel
        stressed out is essential.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Now they are ready to show out!</h2>
